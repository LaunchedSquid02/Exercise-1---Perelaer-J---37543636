Homework Exercise 1: Create Your Own Code


This source code addresses the issue of implementing a straightforward command-line "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game in Python.
 Two players select one of the three possibilities, rock, paper, or scissors, and the winner is decided according to the following rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.

Method for Resolving the Issue:
The following steps are required to solve this issue:

Players' Input: The program will ask the two players which option they prefer (scissors, paper, or rock). 

The software will evaluate the inputs to make sure they are one of the three acceptable choices (rock, paper, scissors). 
The application will ask the participants to enter their selections again if the input is invalid until valid inputs are given.

Comparison: The program will compare the players' selections after receiving valid input from both of them in order to decide the winner in accordance with the game's rules.

Display Result: The program will show the game's outcome, including who won and whether there was a draw.

Play Once More: The software will ask the users if they would like to play one more round. In that case, the game will begin over at step 1. The program will cease if you don't.

If a single-player mode is implemented, the random module in Python can be used to replicate the decision made by the computer.

Overall, the code will offer a fun experience of playing the traditional "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game in the terminal, allowing players to compare their luck and strategies with other players or, in the single-player mode, against the computer.
